# Auto-Eval-24 
**Automated Grading System for True/False Answer Sheets using OCR**

## Overview  
Auto-Eval-24 is a Python-based automated evaluation system designed to grade scanned true/false answer sheets efficiently and accurately. It leverages OCR tools like **Pytesseract** and **EasyOCR**, combined with **OpenCV** and **Pillow**, to extract and evaluate responses with minimal manual effort.

## Features  
- Automatic orientation correction of scanned answer sheets  
- Advanced image preprocessing using OpenCV (Gaussian blur, morphological operations)  
- High-accuracy answer extraction using EasyOCR  
- Fully automated evaluation pipeline  
- Achieves **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.833**

## Tech Stack  
- Python 3.10+  
- OpenCV  
- Pytesseract  
- EasyOCR  
- Pillow (PIL)  
- NumPy
